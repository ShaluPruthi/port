        I'm a self-motivated and continuously learning web developer who loves turning complex problems into simple, intuitive solutions. 
        My journey started with front-end development, where I mastered creating beautiful user interfaces. 
        As I grew, I expanded into back-end technologies to build full-fledged web applications.<br/>
        Currently, I am sharpening my skills in Node.js and Java, expanding my backend and server-side capabilities. 
        I enjoy learning new technologies and constantly challenge myself to keep up with industry trends.
